We also collect data about posts or content that you view, and those that you like or approve of(such as where you like a post without actually posting a written message in response).Taken together, this often gives us a fairly detailed picture of what users like to talk about and who they like to talk with.

                            If you are based in Europe please note that we use service providers that may be based outside of the UK and/or the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). These service providers may work for us or for one of our suppliers and may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your request for information from the Website, the processing of your payment details and the provision of services or support services.

                            We endeavor to minimize the number of international data transfers which take place without your prior knowledge and authorization (such as where you use the Website to interact directly with another user who is based outside of the UK or EEA, where the transfer is one that you actively make happen). Where we do use providers based outside of Europe, we usually do so in order to ensure that the Website can work seamlessly where users in one jurisdiction wish to interact with others.

                            <br>
                            Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld. Transfer of personal data are either made:

This part of The Policy is a mandatory statement which summarizes certain law applicable in your jurisdiction. It is not a replacement for, nor an extension of, your legal rights so should be read only as a summary of that legislation.

                            If you are a resident of one of the regions described above then you have the following rights in relation to your personal data held by A.M. hosting cloud services ltd:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In accordance with the regulations concerning the processing of personal data, the user has the rights listed below. 
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you(you may have heard of this right being described as a "subject access request").
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your personal data.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten”).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so if, for example, we have an ongoing legal obligation or need to continue processing that personal data.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.

                            Your Right to Restrict Processing
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Where we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the sections of this Policy which explain how and why we use your information) you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify that data's accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Your Right to Portability
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Where you wish to transfer personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Because of the kind of work that we do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Your Right to object to processing
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You may object to processing of your personal data where we rely on legitimate interest for processing that personal data. We will comply with your request unless we have a compelling overriding legitimate interest for processing or we need to continue processing your personal data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.

                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Where we send you e-mail marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those communications).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Alternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us directly – you can unsubscribe by writing to us at support@Fanrhythm.com and telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            When you write to us making a request to exercise your rights we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case we will tell you).
