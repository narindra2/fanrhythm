In addition, we will promptly terminate the accounts of those we determined to be "repeat infringers" without notice.

                        Abuse Notification: Abusing the DMCA Notice procedures set forth above, or misrepresenting facts in a DMCA Notice or Counter-notification, can result in legal liability for damages, court costs and attorneys fees under federal law. See; 17 U.S.C. § 512(f). These Notice and Takedown Procedures only apply to claims of copyright infringement by copyright holders and their agents - not to any other kind of abuse, infringement or legal claim. We will investigate and take action against anyone abusing the DMCA notification or counter-notification procedure. Please ensure you meet all legal qualifications before submitting a DMCA Notice to our Designated Agent.

                        Take Down Procedure
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        The Site follows a "notification and takedown" procedure when notified of claimed copyright infringement. The Site reserves the right to disable access to or remove any infringing material. The Site terminates accounts of repeat infringers if appropriate. The DMCA Notice Procedures are set forth in the preceding paragraph. If the Notice does not comply with §512 of the DMCA but does comply with three requirements for identifying sites that are infringing according to §512 of the DMCA, the Site attempts to contact the complaining party to help them comply with notification requirements. When the Designated Agent receives a valid Notice, the Site removes and/or disables access to the infringing material and notifies the affected user. The affected user may submit a counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a statement made under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed because of misidentification of the material. After the Designated Agent receives the counter-notification, it replaces the material at issue within 14 days unless it receives notice that a court action has been filed by the complaining party seeking an injunction against the infringing activity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We reserve the right to remove any content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you. In appropriate circumstances, we will terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer. Our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement appearing on the website is:

                    <p>
                        If you receive a Notice of Claimed Infringement and believe that it is erroneous or false and/or that allegedly infringing material has been wrongly removed in accordance with the procedures outlined above, you may submit a counter-notification pursuant to Section 512(g)(2) & (3) of the DMCA. A counter-notification is the proper method for disputing the removal or disabling of material pursuant to a Notice. The information provided in a counter-notification must be accurate and truthful. The Recipient will be liable for any misrepresentations which may cause any claims to be brought against the Site relating to the actions taken in response to the counter-notification.
