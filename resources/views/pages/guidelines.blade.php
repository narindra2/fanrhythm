                            <br>
                            Your User Content is likely to be considered hateful if it encourages or wishes for violence/physical harm to a particular group of people, encourages for exclusion or segregation of a particular group of people, or if it contains slurs that are intended to degrade or dehumanize a particular group of people.

                            <br>                            
                            <br>
                            This includes sexual material in which participants are unwillingly involved, including intimate photography/video of individuals who were unaware that they were being photographed/filmed or who were unwilling to participate in that process.
                            <br>                            
                            <br>
                            You must not send User Content which is sexual in nature to other Users who have not indicated that they wish to receive it from you by, for example, subscribing to your User Content or through direct communications. This includes intimate photography of yourself.

                        <li>
                            f.	<b>Explicit Content:</b> Explicitly sexual and/or violent content is permitted on the Platform but as the Platform is used by a wide audience of people, you must flag explicitly sexual and/or violent content as “18+ Content”. In addition, you must not make explicit User Content available to Users, as a Paid for Service or otherwise, if you are aware, or ought reasonably to be aware, such Users are under the age of 18. Explicit User Content without the appropriate 18+ Content marking is prohibited and you must not upload it to the Platform.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Explicit User Content depicting, or otherwise involving, any person under the age of 18, including yourself, is prohibited. It is your responsibility to ensure that the subjects of your explicit User Content are over the age of 18 and to maintain appropriate documentation sufficient to evidence the same.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            User Content is likely to be considered explicit if it could be considered inappropriate for people under the age of 18; it contains material which is sexual or pornographic; or it depicts injury or violence in a way that is graphic, gratuitous, obscene or excessive.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Context can be important in making a determination and, in particular, content which represents factual reporting on current events is less likely to be considered explicit where it consists of newsworthy images that help individuals to properly understand the events being reported on. Likewise, images which represent artistic or stylized representations of these subjects are less likely to be considered explicit by us.
